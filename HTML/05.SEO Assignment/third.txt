Q3. What are the Benefits of Using Meta Tags.
Solution-

The Benefits of using Meta tags are as follows
SEO - (Search Engine Optimization): Meta tags, such as the "description" and "keywords" tags, can help
improve a webpage's visibility on search engine result pages (SERPs).

Social Media Sharing - Meta tags like the Open Graph Protocol tags allow developers to control how web
pages are displayed when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

Character Encoding and Language - The meta tag specifying the character encoding (e.g., .TF-8) ensures
that the browser interprets the text correctly, especially when dealing with special characters or multilingual content.

Viewport control - The viewport meta tag is crucial for responsive web design.

HTTP-Equiv tags - Meta tags with http-equiv attribute (e.g., <meta http-equiv="refresh">) enable specific 
HTTP header functionalities, like refreshing or redirecting the page after a certain time.

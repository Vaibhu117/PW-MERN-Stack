4. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.
Tag:
An HTML tag is a snippet of code enclosed within angle brackets ("<" and ">") that defines the purpose and
structure of a specific element on a webpage. Tags are used to instruct the web browser how to display the
content they enclose. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the
element enclosed within the tags.

Example of tag :
<p>This is paragraph tag</p>

Element:
An HTML element is a complete unit that includes an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. It represents a
distinct part of a webpage's content or structure. Elements are composed of tags and the content enclosed
between those tags.

Example of element:
<p>This is paragraph tag</p>

5. What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?
Answer:
The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is a special instruction placed at the beginning of an HTML document to
specify the version of HTML being used. It ensures proper rendering and parsing by web browsers. The most
common declaration, <!DOCTYPE html>, indicates the use of HTML5, the latest version of HTML.

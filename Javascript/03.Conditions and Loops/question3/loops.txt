Solution :
Loops in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data structures, and performing operations on a set of values. JavaScript provides several types of loops, each serving different purposes.

1.for loop :
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a range of values.

Syntax :
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}

Example :
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

2. while loop :
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, and the loop continues as long as a specified condition is true.

Syntax :
while (condition) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}

Example :
let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

3.do-while loop :
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.

Syntax :
do {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
} while (condition);

Example :
let i = 0;

do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);

4.for...in loop :
The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

Syntax :
for (variable in object) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}

Example :
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  job: 'Developer'
};

for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key + ': ' + person[key]);
}

5.for...of loop :
The for...of loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object (e.g., arrays, strings).

Syntax :
for (variable of iterable) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}

Example :
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

for (let color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}


Loops are essential in programming because they allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly without duplicating it. They are particularly useful when working with arrays, lists, and other data structures, enabling efficient processing of elements and reducing code redundancy.

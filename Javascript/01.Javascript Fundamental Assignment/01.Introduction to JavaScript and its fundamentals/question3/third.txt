Solution:
JavaScript has five primitive data types, which are the simplest and most fundamental data types.

1.Number :
The number data type represents numeric values. It can include integers, floating-point numbers and special values like NaN (Not-a-Number) and Infinity.
For example:
let integerNumber = 42;
let floatingPointNumber = 3.14;
let notANumber = NaN;
let positiveInfinity = Infinity;

2.String :
The string data type represents sequences of characters enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backticks (` `)quotes. Strings are used to represent text data.
For example:
let name = "John";
let message = 'Hello, World!';
let templateLiteral = `My name is ${name}`;

3.Boolean :
The boolean data type has only two values, true and false, and is used to represent logical values. Booleans are commonly used for conditions and comparisons.
For example:
let isUserLoggedIn = true;
let isDataValid = false;

4.Null :
The null data type represents the intentional absence of any object value or a value that has been explicitly set to indicate no value. It is often used to initialize variables before assigning meaningful values. 
For example:
let address = null;

5.Undefined :
The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is often the initial value of variables. 
For example:
let firstName; // firstName is undefined

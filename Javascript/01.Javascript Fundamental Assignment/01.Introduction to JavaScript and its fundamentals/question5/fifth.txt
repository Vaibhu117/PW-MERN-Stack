Solution :
Comments in JavaScript are essential for code readability, maintainability and collaboration among developers.They serve several important purposes:

1.Documentation :
Comments provide explanations and context about the code's purpose, logic and
functionality.This makes it easier for other developers (or your future self) to understand and work with the code.

2.Debugging :
Comments can be used to temporarily disable or "comment out" code during debugging,
helping you isolate issues without deleting code.

3.Communication :
Comments allow developers to communicate with each other, explaining why certain
decisions were made or describing how specific code segments work.

4.Organization :
Comments can be used to divide code into logical sections, making it easier to navigate and maintain larger codebases.

5.Legal and Compliance :
In some cases, comments may be required to explain licensing, copyright information or compliance with regulations.

Single-line Comment:
Use double slashes (//) to create single-line comments. Anything after // on the same line is considered a comment and is not executed by the JavaScript interpreter.

// This is a single-line comment
let age = 30; // This comment explains the variable's purpose

Multi-line Comment:
Use /* to begin a multi-line comment and */ to end it. Everything between these symbols is treated as a comment, allowing you to write comments spanning multiple lines.

/*
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It can provide detailed explanations for code blocks.

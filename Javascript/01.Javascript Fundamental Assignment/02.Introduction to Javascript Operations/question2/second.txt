Solution :
Operators in JavaScript are cateorized based on their functionality into the following groups:

1.Arithmetic Operators :
These operators perform mathematical operations on operands. Operands can be
numbers or variables.

// Addition (+)
const sum = 1 + 2; // sum is now equal to 3

// Subtraction (-)
const difference = 10 - 5; // difference is now equal to 5

// Multiplication (*)
const product = 3 * 4; // product is now equal to 12

// Division (/)
const quotient = 12 / 3; // quotient is now equal to 4

// Exponentiation (**)
const power = 2 ** 3; // power is now equal to 8

// Modulo (%)
const remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder is now equal to 1


2.Assignment Operators :
These operators assin values to variables.

// Assignment operator (=)
const myVariable = 10;

// Addition assignment operator (+=)
myVariable += 5; // myVariable is now equal to 15

// Subtraction assignment operator (-=)
myVariable -= 5; // myVariable is now equal to 10

// Multiplication assignment operator (*=)
myVariable *= 2; // myVariable is now equal to 20

// Division assignment operator (/=)
myVariable /= 2; // myVariable is now equal to 10

// Modulo assignment operator (%=)
myVariable %= 3; // myVariable is now equal to 1


3.Comparison Operators :
These operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false).

// Equal to (==)
const isEqual = 10 == 10; // isEqual is now equal to true

// Not equal to (!=)
const isNotEqual = 10 != 10; // isNotEqual is now equal to false

// Greater than (>)
const isGreaterThan = 10 > 5; // isGreaterThan is now equal to true

// Less than (<)
const isLessThan = 10 < 5; // isLessThan is now equal to false

// Greater than or equal to (>=)
const isGreaterThanOrEqual = 10 >= 10; // isGreaterThanOrEqual is now equal to
true

// Less than or equal to (<=)
const isLessThanOrEqual = 10 <= 5; // isLessThanOrEqual is now equal to false


4.Logical Operators :
These operators perform logical operations on Boolean values.

// AND (&&)
const isAndTrue = true && true; // isAndTrue is now equal to true
const isAndFalse = true && false; // isAndFalse is now equal to false

// OR (||)
const isOrTrue = true || false; // isOrTrue is now equal to true
const isOrFalse = false || false; // isOrFalse is now equal to false

// NOT (!)
const isNotTrue = !true; // isNotTrue is now equal to false
const isNotFalse = !false; // isNotFalse is now equal to true

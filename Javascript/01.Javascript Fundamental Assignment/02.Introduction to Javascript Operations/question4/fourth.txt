Solution :

Precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated when multiple operators are present in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are executed first. For example, in the expression 3 + 5 * 2, multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so the multiplication is performed first.

const result = 3 + 5 * 2; // The result will be 13, not 16 (if addition had
higher precedence)

Associativity refers to the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated. Some operators associate left to right, meaning they are evaluated from left to right. Others associate right to left, meaning they are evaluated from right to left.

const result = 10 + 5 + 2; // The result will be 17 (evaluated as (10 + 5) + 2)


Understanding precedence and associativity is important for severa2 reasons:
1.Correct Expression Evaluation :
Understanding the order of precedence ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly, preventing potential errors or unexpected results.
 
2.Predictable Code :
When working with complex expressions, knowing the precedence and associativity
allows developers to write code that behaves as intended, making it easier to reason about and maintain.

3.Debugging and troubleshooting :
In case of unexpected results, knowing operator precedence and associativity helps in debugging and identifying the root cause of issues.

4.Optimizing Code :
Knowledge of precedence and associativity can be used to optimize code by avoiding
unnecessary parentheses and ensuring efficient computation.

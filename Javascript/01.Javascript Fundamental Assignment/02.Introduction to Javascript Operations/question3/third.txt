Solution :
Operators in JavaScript are categorized based on the number of operands they required into the following groups
1.Unary operatorso Unary operators operate on a single operand
2.Binary operatorso Binary operators operate on two operands.

Unary operators in JavaScript are:
1.Unary Plus (+): Converts its operand to a number.
var x = "5";
var y = +x;  // y will be a number (5)

2.Unary Negation (-): Negates its operand, converting it to a number and changing the sign.
var a = 10;
var b = -a;  // b will be -10

3.Logical NOT (!): Converts the operand to a Boolean value and returns the inverse.
var isTrue = true;
var isFalse = !isTrue;  // isFalse will be false

4.Increment (++): Increases the value of its operand by 1.
var count = 5;
count++;  // count will be 6

5.Decrement (--): Decreases the value of its operand by 1.
var count = 5;
count--;  // count will be 4

6.Typeof Operator: Returns a string indicating the type of the operand.
var variable = 42;
console.log(typeof variable);  // prints "number"

7.Bitwise NOT (~): Inverts the bits of its operand.
var num = 5;  // 00000000000000000000000000000101
var inverted = ~num;  // -6 (11111111111111111111111111111010 in 32-bit two's complement)
